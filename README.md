# react-global-state
A global state management boilerplate template for React using hooks.

# You know the drill, right?
1. npm i
2. npm start

# HOW TO USE
1. Define your states globally at GlobalState.jsx using useState, useReducer, useMemo etc hooks.
2. Don't forget to export them.
3. Copy-paste both the state and setter in Context.js
4. Use useStore from GlobalStore.js and take only the required fields in your react component.

### THAT'S ALL FOLKS. Cheers.
